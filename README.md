# End-to-end Playwright tests for OSIM
This repository contains end-to-end tests for [OSIM](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/osim) using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

## Required environment variables

- `OSIM_URL`: URL of the OSIM instance to test
- `OSIDB_URL`: URL of the OSIDB instance to test
- `JIRA_USERNAME`: Username of the authenticated user in JIRA
- `JIRA_API_KEY`: API key for jira
- `BUGZILLA_API_KEY`: API key for bugzilla

The project uses [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to load the environment variables from a `.env` file.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:RedHatProductSecurity/osim-ui-tests.git
cd osim-ui-tests
yarn install
```

This should download the browser binaries for Playwright, if having problems, you can do it manually by running:

```bash
yarn playwright install
```

## Running the tests

You can run Playwright in [UI mode](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-ui-mode) by running:

```bash
yarn dev
```
This mode allows you to run the tests in a browser and see the results in the Playwright UI. Perfect for development and debugging.

To run the tests in headless mode, you can run:

```bash
yarn test
```

or specify the browser to use:

```bash
yarn test:firefox # see package.json for more options
```
